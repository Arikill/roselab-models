Welcome to Roselab models.

This is a collaborative project between Roselab @ The University of Utah, and Lemmonlab @ Florida State University.

Models developed based on discovery of neural computation mechanism in the auditory midbrain by Drs. Rose & Alluri.

Mechanism References:
1) Short-pass duration seletivity mechanism (Alluri et al., 2016): https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.1520971113
2) Long interval selectivity mechanism (Alluri et al., 2021): https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7925425
3) Possible mechanisms for counting (Naud et al,. 2015): https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26334004

The fundamental elements of the model were developed by Dr. Rishi Alluri, School of Biological Sciences, UofU.
The evolutionary models of circuits & optimization are developed by Dr. Alan Lemmon, Scientific Computing, FSU.
